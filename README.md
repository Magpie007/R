# Nonlinear Regression with R
Nonlinear regression methods are suited for analysing data for which there is an empirically or theoretically established functional relationship between response and predictor.

The algorithm for estimation in nonlinear regression is the Gauss-Newtown method. The numerical optimization methods are not perfect. 

The solutions may differ as a consequence of different algorithms, different implementations of the same algorithm, different parameterizations, or different starting values.
