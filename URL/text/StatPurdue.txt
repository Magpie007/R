1. Investigate features of a single variable
1.1 The varialbe is continuous, then
        begin from "one sample t-test"
1.2 The variable is categorical, then
        begin from "Goodness-of-fit-test"

2. Investigate effect of (independent) variable(s) on other (dependent) variable(s)

2.1 There is one dependent variable and one independent variable
2.1.1 The dependent variable is continuous
2.1.1.1 The independent variable is categorical
        The independent variables has two categories (e.g., female/male)
        - The samples are independent, then     
            begin from "two sample t-test" (follow normal distribution-conduct normality check)
            or use "Wilcoxon rank sum test" if you know data is not normally distributed
        - The samples are dependent, then 
             begin from "paired t-test" (follow normal distribution - conduct normality check)
             or use "Wilcoxon sign rank test" if you know data is not normally distributed

         The independent variables has three or more categories (e.g., black/red/white)
         - The samples are independent, then 
             begin from "ANOVA" (follow normal distribution and have similar standard deviation)
             or use "Kruskal Wallis test" if you know data is not normally distributed
             or use Welch test if you know data has heterogreneity variance
         - The samples are dependent, then 
             suggest methods that consider repeated measurement        
2.1.1.2 The independent variable is continuous, then
          begin from "linear regression"
2.1.2 The dependent variable is categorical
2.1.2.1 The indepenent variable is categorical
        - The samples are independent (such as female/male), then
            begin from contingency test
            or use "Fisher's exact test", if you know the sample size is relatively small
        - The samples are dependent (e.g, wife/husband),then 
            begin from McNemar's test
2.1.2.2 The independent variable is continuous, then 
          begin from "logit regression"

2.2 There is one dependent variable and multiple independent variables
2.2.1 The dependent variable is continous
      The independent variables are categorical, then
        begin from "N-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)"
      The indepenent variables are continuous, then
2.2.2 The dependent variable is categorical, then
